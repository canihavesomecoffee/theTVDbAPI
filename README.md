This is an API client for the thetvdb.com website. It's using the **3rd**, improved API version (RESTful). In order to be
 able to access this API you'll have to register on theTVDb first.
 
 **Important notice: This API version (3) of theTVDb will be superseded by a new version early 2021 (unknown release date). No details are available on the new version as of yet, but we will look into making a new API wrapper available when these details become available.**

This API implementation can be considered a mix between adrenth/thetvdb2 and Moinax/TvDb.

## API Key Registration

To use this PHP package, you need to request an API Key from the thetvdb.com website: [https://thetvdb.com/dashboard/account/apikeys](https://thetvdb.com/dashboard/account/apikeys).

To use the API, there are a few guidelines (taken from [API information page](https://thetvdb.com/api-information)):

> Free, open source projects are welcome to use our API, images, and data as long as they provide attribution including a link to our site. If you sell your app, provide subscription based services, or sell advertising on your app or website, we consider you a commercial project. Commercial projects, both publicly and privately available to at least 10 users, are required to arrange a commercial license. Commercial projects are able to use our API without restriction during development. We often exclude projects from licensing fees until they are financially successful, but this is solely our decision.
>
> We reserve the right to change our interfaces, fees, or licensing terms at any point without notice.

Please keep these guidelines in mind when making use of this API client. For information on how to comply with attribution, please refer to the page linked above.
